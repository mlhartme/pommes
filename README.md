# Pommes

Pommes is a project checkout manager and database tool, you can use it search for projects and keep their checkouts 
organized on your disk. Here's an example:
    
    ~/Projects $ pommes goto lavender
    [1]   Projects/svn.1and1.org/sales/tools/lavender
    [2] A Projects/github.com/net/oneandone/lavender (git:ssh://git@github.com/mlhartme/lavender.git)
    Please select: 2
    [/Projects/github.com/net/oneandone] git clone ssh://git@github.com/mlhartme/lavender.git lavender
    ~/Projects/github.com/net/oneandone/lavender $ 

This command searches the database for `lavender` projects and lets you choose between the hits. Selecting `1` would 
simply cd into the already existing checkout, choosing `2` also creates the checkout. 

Technically, Pommes is a command line tool that maintains a database with project metadata. Pommes can:
* index repositories (e.g. github or github) to populate the database
* search the database by coordinates, dependencies, scm location, etc. 
* perform (bulk-) checkouts for all projects that match a query.

Pommes detects addition metadata for Maven projects with a `pom.xml` file and php projects with a `composer.json` file. 

The name Pommes stands for "many poms", "project mess", or a german word for french fries.

## Setup

Prerequisites
* Linux or Mac
* Git
* Java 17 or higher
* Maven 3.6 or higher

Install the application
* open https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/oneandone/pommes/, choose the latest version and download the  `pommes-x.y.z-application.sh` file,
  store it as executable `pommes` file in your path

        cd some-directory-in-your-path
        curl https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/net/oneandone/pommes/3.4.0/pommes-3.4.0-application.sh -o pommes
        chmod a+x pommes
    
* run `pommes setup` and follow the instructions. Basically, this sets up Pommes with root directory `~/Projects`, 
  configuration and other files will be stored in `~/Projects/.pommes`. To set up a different directory, pass it as an argument on the 
  command line

## Managing the Database

Pommes maintains a [Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org) database to store project metadata. The database is filled
by indexing so-called repositories. The database is stored in `$POMMES_ROOT/.pommes/database`, it's safe to delete this
directory to wipe the database.

`.pommes/config` defines databases in the form *repository.<name> = <url> {<option>}*
* name is an arbitrary name
* url is the primary definition of the repository, the protocol distinishes the repository type
  * github:<url-of-github-api>
  * gitlab:<url-of-gitlab-server>
  * json:<url-pointing-to-json-file>
  * file:///path-to-local-directory-with checkouts
* options depend on the repository type

Example urls

       repository.mlhartme=github:https://api.github.com %~mlhartme
       repository.company=gitlab:https://gitlab.company.com 

You can configure access token for github and gitlab by storing them in a file $POMMES_ROOT/.pommes/<reponame>-<protocol>.token.
For example, a token in file $POMMES_ROOT/.pommes/github-mlhartme.token will be used to index the above mlhartme repository.

## Find Command

Pommes stores the following fields for every project added to the database:
* `id` - zone and origin (i.e. url where the project descriptor (usually the pom) was loaded from)
* `revision` - last modified timestamp or content hash (to detect changes when re-adding a project)
* `parent` - parent pom coordinates; optional, may be missing
* `artifact` - coordinates of this project
* `scm` - where to find this project in a source code management system
* `dep` - coordinates of dependencies; optional list
* `url` - project url; optional, may be missing

You search the database with the `find` command: `pommes find foo` lists all projects that have a `foo` substring in their 
artifact or scm field. The default is to print the artifact field of matching projects. You can append `-json` to get all fields 
in json format instead. 

Next, you can search for specific fields using one or multiple field identifiers. A field identifier is the first letter of the 
field name:
* `pommes find d:bar` lists projects with a `bar` substring in their dependencies
* `pommes find dp:baz` lists projects with a `baz` substring in their dependency or parent

(Technically, `pommes find foo` is a short-hand for `pommes find :foo`, and this in turn is a short-hand for `pommes find as:foo`)

You can also prepend fields with `!` for negation. In this case, you should enclose the query argument in single quote, otherwise, the shell 
will expand the `!`. Example: `pommes find '!d:bar'` list all projects that have no dependency with a `bar` substring.

Next, you can combine queries with `+` to list projects matching both conditions. I.e. `+` means *and*.
* `pommes find a:puc+d:httpcore` lists projects with a `puc` substring in its artifact and `httpcore` in its dependencies.

Finally, you can combine queries with blanks to list projects matching one of the conditions. I.e. blank means *or*.
* `pommes find d:puc d:pommes` lists projects depending on either `puc` or `pommes`.

See the usage message below for the full query syntax.

TODO: Prefix, suffix, macros; formats


## Checkout commands

Checkout commands (`checkout`, `goto` and `st`) manage checkouts on your disk, e.g. run scm operations on projects that 
match a query. Pommes supports Subversion and Git scms. The root directory for all checkouts is the directory containing
`.pommes`.


### Checkout

`pommes checkout s:/mlhartme` checks out all mlhartme projects.

Before changing anything on your disk, `checkout` presents a selection of the checkouts to perform, and you can pick one, multiple 
(separated with blanks) or all of them. Or you can quit without doing anything.

If a checkout already exists on your disk, it is not touched. This is useful to checkout newly created projects by just re-running your 
checkout command.


### Goto

`pommes goto sushi`

searches the database for `sushi`, offers a selection of matching projects, checks it out if necessary,
and cds into the resulting directory.


### Status

`pommes st` lists all checkouts in the current directory, together with a status marker similar to `git status`. 


## Glossary for reading the source code

Descriptor: references a project, various implementation to load Maven, Json, etc

Project: holds project metadata: gav, parent, dependencies, scm, url

Repository: can be scanned for descriptors

Database: stores projects (in Lucene)
