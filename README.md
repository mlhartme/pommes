# Pommes

Pommes is a project database tool. It's a command line tool to
* crawl directories, svn, github, bitbucket or artifactory and add matching projects to the database
* search the database by coordinates, dependencies, scm location, etc. 
* perform (bulk-) scm operations, e.g. checkout all projects that match a query.
  
Pommes supports Maven projects with a pom.xml file and php projects with a composer.json file. Php support is very basic. 
The name Pommes stands for "many poms".

## Setup

Prerequisites
* Java 8 or higher
* Linux or Mac

Install the application
* download the latest `application.sh` file from [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22net.oneandone%22%20AND%20a%3A%22pommes%22) 
* rename it to `pommes`, make it executable and add it to your path.
* Define a shell function `pg` to invoke `pommes goto` and actually cd into the resulting directory:
       function pg {
         pommes goto "$@" && . ~/.pommes.goto
       }
* test it by running `pommes`, you should get a usage message listing available commands
* inspect the configuration file at `~/.pommes.properties` and adjust it to your needs.
 
Current Limitations
* doesn't care about git branches
* multi-module projects are not handles properly: only the top-level pom is added to the database.

## Database commands

Pommes uses (Lucene)[http://lucene.apache.org] to store projects. You have three commands to  modify it: `database-add` and `database-remove` 
to add/remove projects, and `database-reset` to reset the database to the initial state.
                                                                         
Use `pommes database-add` to add projects to your database. You can crawl various repositories to for projects.

Local files:

    pommes database-add ~/.m2/repository
    
adds all Maven Poms in your local repository.

Subversion:

    pommes database-add 'svn:https://user:password@svn.yourcompany.com/your/repo/path'

adds alls project in the specified Subversion subtree.

Artifactory:

    pommes database-add 'artifactory:https://user:password@artifactory.yourcompany.com/your/repo/path' 
    
adds all project found in the respective Artifactory repository subtree.

Github:

    pommes database-add github:someuser

adds all projects of the specified user (or organization) to your database.

Note that `database-add` overwrites projects already in the database, so you don't get duplicate projects from duplicate add commands.
The id field is used to detect duplicates, the revision field to detect modifications.  

## Find Command

Pommes stores 7 fields for every project added to the database:
* `id` - zone and repository uri where the project was imported from
* `revision` - last modified timestamp or content hash (to detect changes when re-adding a project)
* `parent` - parent pom coordinates
* `artifact` - coordinates of this project
* `scm` - where to find this probject in scm
* `dep` - coordinates of dependencies
* `url` - project url

Start with `pommes find foo`, it lists all projects that have a `foo` substring in their artifact or scm field. 

Next, you can search for specific fields using one or multiple field identifiers - i.e. the first letter of the field name
* `pommes find d:bar` lists projects with a `bar` substring in their dependencies
* `pommes find dp:baz` lists projects with a `baz` substring in their dependency or parent

(Technically, `pommes find foo` is a short-hand for `pommes find :foo`, and this in turn is a short-hand for `pommes find as:foo`)

Next, you can combine queries with `+` to list projects matching both conditions. I.e. + means and.
* `pommes find a:puc+d:httpcore` lists projects with a `puc` substring in it artifact and `httpcore` in its dependencies.

Finally, you can combine queries with blanks to list projects matching one of the conditions. I.e. blank means or.
* `pommes find d:puc d:pommes` lists projects depending on either `puc` or `pommes`.

## Mount commands

You can use mount commands to run scm operations one the projects that match a query. The `mount.root` property defines the root directory
where you want checkouts to show up on your disk. 

### Mount

`pommes mount s:/trunk` checks out all trunks.

Before changing anything on your disk, the mount command presents a selection of the checkouts to perform, and you can pick one, multiple 
(separated with blanks) or all of them. Or you can quit without doing anything.

If a checkout already exists on your disk, it is not touched. This is useful to checkout newly created projects by just re-running your 
mount command.

### Umount

The `umount` command is equivalent to removing checkouts from your disk with `rm -rf`, but it also checks for uncommitted changes before 
changing anything. Similar the `mount` command, it asks before changing anything on your disk.

`umount` has a `-stale` option to remove only checkouts that have been removed from the database. For example, if you have 
all trunks checked out, you can run `pommes umount -stale` to remove checkouts that are no longer used.


### Ls

`pommes ls` lists all checkouts in the current directory, together with a status marker.

### Pg

`pg puc`

searches the database for `puc`, offers a selection of matching projects, checks it out and cds into the resulting directory.

Technically, pg is a shell function that invokes `pommes goto`.

## Advanced 

You can define imports in the properties file:

   import.foo=baruri
   
instructs pommes auto automatically run 

   database-add -zone foo baruri
   
once a day. Or if you invoke it with `-import`. 

This is most usefull with json repositories because they are very fast. To create a json file, run your database-add commands and run

    pommes find -output foo.json "" -json
    
You can also specify a webdav url to automatically upload the file. It will be compressed if the url ends with .gz.

You might want to setup a cron job to run this every night. Alternatively, you can setup post-commit hooks to 
trigger `database-add` and `database-remove` calls after each committed pom.xml modification.
